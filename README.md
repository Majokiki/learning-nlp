This is my journal on learning NLP following curriculum made by Siraj Raval. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GazFsfcijXQ) and the complete curriculum in his repo [here](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn-Natural-Language-Processing-Curriculum).

## Objective

My goal on starting this learning process is to deepen my understanding on Natural Language Processing field and apply it in immediate time to my professional work since I have just started to work as Data Science Engineer in one of startups in Jakarta with focusing more on NLP project.
